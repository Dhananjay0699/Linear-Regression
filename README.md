# Linear-Regression

Linear Regression Model
This model is a simple linear regression algorithm implemented in Python. It can be used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more input features, with the assumption that there is a linear relationship between the inputs and the output.

Installation
This package requires python version 3 and the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib (for visualization)
You can install these libraries by running the following command:

<b>pip install -r requirements.txt</b>

Usage
The model can be trained and used to make predictions as follows:

from linear_regression import LinearRegression

# Load your data
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = ...

# Initialize the model
reg = LinearRegression()

# Train the model
reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the model to make predictions
y_pred = reg.predict(X_test)

Parameters
The following parameters can be adjusted when initializing the LinearRegression object:

learning_rate: the step size for gradient descent (default is 0.01)
num_iterations: the number of iterations for gradient descent (default is 1000)
intercept: whether to include an intercept term in the model (default is True)
normalize: whether to normalize the input features before fitting the model (default is False)
